# exploration-of-large-datasets-using-bit-map-indexing
Bitmap indexing is a technique used in databases to efficiently handle large volumes of data. In these bitmaps, each bit corresponds to a record in the database, with the bit set to 1 if the corresponding record belongs to that category and 0 if it doesn’t.

Bitmap indexing acts as a map or index that guides you to the specific records you're interested in,making data exploration much more efficient and interactive.
The bitmap indexing scheme is knownto not suffer fromthe “curse of dimensionality” and is especially efficient when the queriesdo not involve all of the attributes. 
It's like having a roadmap that helps you navigate through a vast landscape of data with ease.
On uniform grids, our bitmap based approaches for region growing and region tracking are theoretically optimal. 
Bitmap index does not require one to reorder the records in a particular way,thus we can keep the records ordered to preserve neighborhood relation for the region growing Compared to those that require reordering, it requires less time to create a bitmap index. The compressed bitmaps can also be used efficiently for region growing and region tracking.
